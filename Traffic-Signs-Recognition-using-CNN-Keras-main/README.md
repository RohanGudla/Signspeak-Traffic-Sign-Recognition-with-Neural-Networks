# Traffic Signs Recognition with CNN using Keras

## Problem Statement

Autonomous vehicles require the ability to interpret traffic signs accurately to ensure safe and efficient operations. This project aims to develop a model for traffic sign recognition, a crucial component of autonomous vehicle technology.

## Traffic Signs Recognition

Traffic sign recognition involves identifying the class or category of a given traffic sign, including speed limits, no-entry signs, traffic signals, turn indicators, and more.

## About the Python Project

This Python project focuses on building a deep neural network model capable of classifying traffic signs found in images into different categories. This ability is vital for autonomous vehicles to navigate roads safely.

## Dataset

The project utilizes the publicly available Kaggle dataset:
[Traffic Signs Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign/code)

The dataset consists of over 50,000 images representing 43 different traffic sign classes. Some classes have more images than others, and the dataset size is approximately 300 MB. It comprises a "train" folder containing class-specific images and a "test" folder for model testing.

## Model Development

The project involves the following steps:
- Dataset exploration
- CNN model construction
- Model training and validation
- Model testing using the test dataset

## Output

The project generates visual outputs depicting various aspects of traffic sign recognition.

## GUI App

A graphical user interface (GUI) application is also developed for interactive traffic sign recognition.
